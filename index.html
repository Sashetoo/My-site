    Hi, my name is Aleks and I am eleven years old. I love basketball and my favourite school subject is physical education.
    My school starts at 9 AM and ends at 1:50 PM everyday. They always give us alot of homework but I am used to it. I would love
    it if the school was more focused on basketball.

    This is our town Botevgrad. It is kind of small but we love it. It is so small, that every time I go outside I see someone that I know.
    I suggest you visit Botevgrad because there is a museum and a clock tower.

    The clock tower in Botevgrad
</h3>
<img class="clock-tower-img" src="botevgrad.jpg">
<p class="clock-tower-facts">
    The clock tower was built while Bulgaria was still under Ottoman rule by the master Vuno Markov from Vrachesh as a part of 
    large-scale construction in 1866 on the occasion of the announcement of the village Samundjievo as town and district center by 
    proposal of Midhat Pasha. The clock mechanism was made by the local ironmonger Gencho Nakov, and the bell by master 
    Lazar Dimitrov from Bansko.
