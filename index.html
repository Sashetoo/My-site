    Hi, my name is Aleks and I am eleven years old. I love basketball and my favourite school subject is physical education.
    My school starts at 9 AM and ends at 1:50 PM everyday. They always give us alot of homework but I am used to it. I would love
    it if the school was more focused on basketball.

    This is our town Botevgrad. It is kind of small but we love it. It is so small, that every time I go outside I see someone that I know.
    I suggest you visit Botevgrad because there is a museum and a clock tower.
